# Crash-Report-Data-Cleaning-Wrangling-in-Power-BI-
This project is meant to showcase processing skills to obtain potential insights from messy data. Original dataset came from Power BI course from Data Analyst Builder (by Alex Freberg). However, originally the dataset is just an example to show what editing in Power Query Editor looks like. The rest of report and data cleaning came from my own.
